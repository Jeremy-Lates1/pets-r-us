            Marley is our dog of the week. Marley is 11 years old and has had a
            tumor removed this week. They are not sure if it is cancer or not.
            Marley has been a trooper through it all. He continues to eat all
            his food and tries to stay playful as possible. Marley get well
            soon. Our pet of the week.
